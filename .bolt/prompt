For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.

Do not write code that will trigger this error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

make it mobile responsive

Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.

Document all requirements I gave you into the docs folder.
Document all functional/non-functional features, implementation details, and the intended user experience into the docs folder.
